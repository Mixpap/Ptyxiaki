	abstract = {Where do stars come from and how do they form? These are profound questions which link the nature of our Universe to the roots of mankind. Yet, until a recent revolution in understanding, the proposed answers have been raw speculation. Now, accompanying penetrating observations, a new picture has come into prominence. This book presents the latest astounding observations and scientific ideas covering star formation, star birth and early development. It encompasses all aspects, from the dramatic stories of individual objects, to the collective influence of entire stellar systems. The very first stars to come into existence and the nurturing of planets are discussed to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview. Presenting background information with only the essential mathematics, this book will appeal to scientists wishing to expand their horizons, students seeking solid foundations, and general readers with enquiring minds.},

	abstract = {Star formation lies at the center of a web of processes that drive cosmic evolution: generation of radiant energy, synthesis of elements, formation of planets, and development of life. Decades of observations have yielded a variety of empirical rules about how it operates, but at present we have no comprehensive, quantitative theory. In this review I discuss the current state of the field of star formation, focusing on three central questions: what controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy converts to stars? What determines how those stars are clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population ends up in gravitationally-bound structures? What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment? I use these three question as a lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginning with a review of the observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve each of the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunities for theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them. I conclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in the coming years.},

	abstract = {We present 12CO, 13CO and C18O J=3-2 maps of the W3 {GMC} made at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We combine these observations with Five Colleges Radio Astronomy Observatory {CO} J=1-0 data to produce the first map of molecular-gas temperatures across a {GMC} and the most accurate determination of the mass distribution in W3 yet obtained. We measure excitation temperatures in the part of the cloud dominated by triggered star formation (the High Density Layer, {HDL}) of 15-30 K, while in the rest of the cloud, which is relatively unaffected by triggering (Low Density Layer, {LDL}), the excitation temperature is generally less than 12 K. We identify a temperature gradient in the {HDL} which we associate with an age sequence in the embedded massive star-forming regions. We measure the mass of the cloud to be 4.4+/-0.4 x 10{\textasciicircum}5 solar masses, in agreement with previous estimates. Existing sub-mm continuum data are used to derive the fraction of gas mass in dense clumps as a function of position in the cloud. This fraction, which we interpret as a Clump Formation Efficiency ({CFE}), is significantly enhanced across the {HDL}, probably due to the triggering. Finally, we measure the 3D rms Mach Number as a function of position and find a correlation between the Mach number and the {CFE} within the {HDL} only. This correlation is interpreted as due to feedback from the newly-formed stars and a change in its slope between the three main star-forming regions is construed as another evolutionary effect. We conclude that triggering has affected the star-formation process in the W3 {GMC} primarily by creating additional dense structures that can collapse into stars. Any traces of changes in {CFE} due to additional turbulence have since been overruled by the feedback effects of the star-forming process itself.},

	abstract = {In this work we have carried out an in-depth analysis of the young stellar content in the W3 {GMC}. The {YSO} population was identified and classified in the {IRAC}/{MIPS} color-magnitude space according to the `Class' scheme and compared to other classifications based on intrinsic properties. Class 0/I and {II} candidates were also compared to low/intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars selected through their colors and magnitudes in 2MASS. We find that a reliable color/magnitude selection of low-mass {PMS} stars in the infrared requires prior knowledge of the protostar population, while intermediate mass objects can be more reliably identified. By means of the {MST} algorithm and our {YSO} spatial distribution and age maps we investigated the {YSO} groups and the star formation history in W3. We find signatures of clustered and distributed star formation in both triggered and quiescent environments. The central/western parts of the {GMC} are dominated by large scale turbulence likely powered by isolated bursts of star formation that triggered secondary star formation events. Star formation in the eastern high density layer also shows signs of extended periods of star formation. While our findings support triggering as a key factor for inducing and enhancing some of the major star forming activity in the {HDL} (e.g., W3 Main/W3({OH})), we argue that some degree of quiescent or spontaneous star formation is required to explain the observed {YSO} population. Our results also support previous studies claiming an spontaneous origin for the isolated massive star(s) powering {KR} 140.},

	shorttitle = {{HARP}/{ACSIS}},
	abstract = {This paper describes a new Heterodyne Array Receiver Programme ({HARP}) and Auto-Correlation Spectral Imaging System ({ACSIS}) that have recently been installed and commissioned on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope ({JCMT}). The 16-element focal-plane array receiver, operating in the submillimetre from 325 to 375 {GHz}, offers high (three-dimensional) mapping speeds, along with significant improvements over single-detector counterparts in calibration and image quality. Receiver temperatures are \${\textbackslash}sim\$120 K across the whole band and system temperatures of \${\textbackslash}sim\$300K are reached routinely under good weather conditions. The system includes a single-sideband filter so these are {SSB} figures. Used in conjunction with {ACSIS}, the system can produce large-scale maps rapidly, in one or more frequency settings, at high spatial and spectral resolution. Fully-sampled maps of size 1 square degree can be observed in under 1 hour. The scientific need for array receivers arises from the requirement for programmes to study samples of objects of statistically significant size, in large-scale unbiased surveys of galactic and extra-galactic regions. Along with morphological information, the new spectral imaging system can be used to study the physical and chemical properties of regions of interest. Its three-dimensional imaging capabilities are critical for research into turbulence and dynamics. In addition, {HARP}/{ACSIS} will provide highly complementary science programmes to wide-field continuum studies, and produce the essential preparatory work for submillimetre interferometers such as the {SMA} and {ALMA}.},

	approximately satisfy the virial theorem. The observation of moderate scatter in the dispersion-size relation is noted to imply that most regions have not collapsed much since formation, suggesting that processes of turbulent hydrodynamics have played an important role in producing the observed substructures. A lower limit to the size of subcondensations at which their internal motions are no longer
	supersonic is shown to predict a minimum protostellar mass on the order of a few tenths of a solar mass, while massive protostellar clumps are found to develop complex internal structures, probably leading to the formation of prestellar condensation nuclei. The observed turbulence of molecular clouds is noted to imply lifetimes of less than 10 million years.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the Planck 857, 545 and 353 {GHz}, and {IRAS} 100 micron data. Using a modified black-body fit to the data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, and spectral index over the 353-3000 {GHz} range. This model is a tight representation of the data at 5 arc min. It shows variations of the order of 30 \% compared with the widely-used model of Finkbeiner, Davis, and Schlegel. The Planck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the whole sky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared to previous all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. An increase of the dust opacity at 353 {GHz}, tau\_353/N\_H, from the diffuse to the denser interstellar medium ({ISM}) is reported. It is associated with a decrease in the observed dust temperature, T\_obs, that could be due at least in part to the increased dust opacity. We also report an excess of dust emission at {HI} column densities lower than 10{\textasciicircum}20 cm{\textasciicircum}-2 that could be the signature of dust in the warm ionized medium. In the diffuse {ISM} at high Galactic latitude, we report an anti-correlation between tau\_353/N\_H and T\_obs while the dust specific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency (the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. The implication is that in the diffuse high-latitude {ISM} tau\_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dust column density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlation of tau\_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements on stars is strong. To estimate Galactic E(B-V) in extragalactic fields at high latitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead of the dust optical depth, calibrated to E(B-V) using reddening measurements of quasars deduced from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data.},

	shorttitle = {{APEX}-{CHAMP}+ high-J {CO} observations of low-mass young stellar objects},
	abstract = {During the embedded stage of star formation, bipolar molecular outflows and {UV} radiation from the protostar are important feedback processes. Our aim is to quantify the feedback, mechanical and radiative, for a large sample of low-mass sources. The outflow activity is compared to radiative feedback in the form of {UV} heating by the accreting protostar to search for correlations and evolutionary trends. Large-scale maps of 26 young stellar objects, which are part of the Herschel {WISH} key program are obtained using the {CHAMP}+ instrument on the {APEX} (12CO and 13CO 6-5), and the {HARP}-B instrument on the {JCMT} (12CO and 13CO 3-2). Maps are used to determine outflow parameters and envelope models are used to quantify the amount of {UV}-heated gas and its temperature from 13CO 6-5 observations. All sources in our sample show outflow activity and the outflow force, F\_CO, is larger for Class 0 sources than for Class I sources, even if their luminosities are comparable. The outflowing gas typically extends to much greater distances than the power-law envelope and therefore influences the surrounding cloud material directly. Comparison of the {CO} 6-5 results with Herschel-{HIFI} H2O and {PACS} high-J {CO} lines, both tracing currently shocked gas, shows that the two components are linked, even though the transitions do not probe the same gas. The link does not extend down to {CO} 3-2. The conclusion is that {CO} 6-5 depends on the shock characteristics (density and velocity), whereas {CO} 3-2 is more sensitive to conditions in the surrounding environment (density). The radiative feedback is responsible for increasing the gas temperature by a factor of two, up to 30-50 K, on scales of a few thousand {AU}, particularly along the direction of the outflow. The mass of the {UV} heated gas exceeds the mass contained in the entrained outflow in the inner {\textasciitilde}3000 {AU} and is therefore at least as important on small scales.},

Part of the W3 {GMC} is subject to an interaction with the {HII} region and fast stellar winds generated by the nearby W4 {OB} association. We find that the fraction of total gas mass in dense, 850-μm traced structures is significantly altered by this interaction, being around 5-13 per cent in the

There is little evidence of any difference between the index of the high-mass end of the clump mass function in the compressed region and in the unaffected cloud.

Some, but not all, of the high-mass stars producing hypercompact and ultracompact H {II} ({UC} H {II}) regions are also seen, as reported in a previous study. The Chandra images reveal three dramatically different embedded stellar populations. The W3 Main cluster extends over 7 pc with {\textasciitilde}900 X-ray stars in a nearly spherical distribution centered on the well-studied {UC} H {II} regions and high-mass protostars.

In W3 Main, the inferred ages of the widely distributed {PMS} stars are significantly older than the inferred ages of the central {OB} stars illuminating the {UC} H {II} regions. We suggest that different formation mechanisms are necessary to explain the diversity of the W3 stellar populations: cluster-wide gravitational collapse with delayed {OB} star formation in W3 Main, collect-and-collapse triggering by shock fronts in W3({OH}), and a runaway O star or isolated massive star formation in W3 North.},

	abstract = {We have mapped the W 3 giant molecular cloud in the C{\textasciicircum}0 {\textasciicircum}3P\_1--{\textasciicircum}3P\_0 ([{CI}]) line with the Mount Fuji Submillimeter-wave Telescope. The [{CI}] emission is extended over the molecular cloud, having peaks at three star forming clouds; W 3(Main), W 3({OH}), and {AFGL} 333. The [{CI}] emission is found to be strong in the {AFGL} 333 cloud. We have also observed the C18O, {CCS}, N\_2H{\textasciicircum}+, and H13CO{\textasciicircum}+ lines by using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope. In the {AFGL} 333 cloud, we find two massive cores, which are highly gravitationally bound and have no sign of active star formation. The high [C{\textasciicircum}0]/[{CO}] and [{CCS}]/[N\_2H{\textasciicircum}+] abundance ratios suggest that the {AFGL} 333 cloud is younger than the W 3(Main) and W 3({OH}) clouds.},

	abstract = {A detailed radiative transfer analysis of the observed continuum and 
	molecular line emission toward the deeply embedded young stellar object
	{IRAS} 16293-2422 is performed. Accurate molecular
	abundances and abundance changes with radius are presented. The
	continuum modelling is used to constrain the temperature and density
	distributions in the envelope, enabling quantitative estimates of
	various molecular abundances. The density structure is well described by
	a single power-law falling off as r-1.7, i.e., in the range
	of values predicted by infall models. A detailed analysis of the
	molecular line emission strengthens the adopted physical model and lends
	further support that parts of the circumstellar surroundings of
	{IRAS} 16293-2422 are in a state of collapse. The
	molecular excitation analysis reveals that the emission from some
	molecular species is well reproduced assuming a constant fractional
	abundance throughout the envelope. The abundances and isotope ratios are
	generally close to typical values found in cold molecular clouds in
	these cases, and there is a high degree of deuterium fractionation.
	There are, however, a number of notable exceptions. Lines covering a
	wide range of excitation conditions indicate for some molecules, e.g.,
	H\_2CO, {CH}\_3OH, {SO}, {SO}\_2 and {OCS}, a drastic increase in their abundances
	in the warm and dense inner region of the circumstellar envelope. The
	location at which this increase occurs is consistent with the radius at
	which ices are expected to thermally evaporate off the grains. In all,
	there is strong evidence for the presence of a ``hot core'' close to the
	protostar, whose physical properties are similar to those detected
	towards most high mass protostars except for a scaling factor. However,
	the small scale of the hot gas and the infalling nature of the envelope
	lead to very different chemical time scales between low mass and high
	mass hot cores, such that only very rapidly produced second-generation
	complex molecules can be formed in {IRAS} 16293-2422.
	Alternatively, the ices may be liberated due to grain-grain collisions
	in turbulent shear zones where the outflow interacts with the envelope.
	Higher angular resolution observations are needed to pinpoint the origin
	of the abundance enhancements and distinguish these two scenarios. The
	accurate molecular abundances presented for this low-mass protostar
	serve as a reference for comparison with other objects, in particular
	circumstellar disks and comets.},
