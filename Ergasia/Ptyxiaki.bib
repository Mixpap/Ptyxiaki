Yet, until a recent revolution in understanding, the proposed answers have been raw speculation. Now, accompanying penetrating observations, a new picture has come into prominence. This book presents the latest astounding observations and scientific ideas covering star formation, star birth and early development. It encompasses all aspects, from the dramatic stories of individual objects, to the collective influence of entire stellar systems. The very first stars to come into existence and the nurturing of planets are discussed to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview. Presenting background information with only the essential mathematics, this book will appeal to scientists wishing to expand their horizons, students seeking solid foundations, and general readers with enquiring minds.},

	shorttitle = {The Big Problems in Star Formation},
	abstract = {Star formation lies at the center of a web of processes that drive cosmic evolution: generation of radiant energy, synthesis of elements, formation of planets, and development of life. Decades of observations have yielded a variety of empirical rules about how it operates, but at present we have no comprehensive, quantitative theory. In this review I discuss the current state of the field of star formation, focusing on three central questions: what controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy converts to stars? What determines how those stars are clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population ends up in gravitationally-bound structures? What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment? I use these three question as a lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginning with a review of the observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve each of the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunities for theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them. I conclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in the coming years.},

	shorttitle = {The Gas Properties of the W3 {GMC}},
	abstract = {We present 12CO, 13CO and C18O J=3-2 maps of the W3 {GMC} made at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We combine these observations with Five Colleges Radio Astronomy Observatory {CO} J=1-0 data to produce the first map of molecular-gas temperatures across a {GMC} and the most accurate determination of the mass distribution in W3 yet obtained. We measure excitation temperatures in the part of the cloud dominated by triggered star formation (the High Density Layer, {HDL}) of 15-30 K, while in the rest of the cloud, which is relatively unaffected by triggering (Low Density Layer, {LDL}), the excitation temperature is generally less than 12 K. We identify a temperature gradient in the {HDL} which we associate with an age sequence in the embedded massive star-forming regions. We measure the mass of the cloud to be 4.4+/-0.4 x 10{\textasciicircum}5 solar masses, in agreement with previous estimates. Existing sub-mm continuum data are used to derive the fraction of gas mass in dense clumps as a function of position in the cloud. This fraction, which we interpret as a Clump Formation Efficiency ({CFE}), is significantly enhanced across the {HDL}, probably due to the triggering. Finally, we measure the 3D rms Mach Number as a function of position and find a correlation between the Mach number and the {CFE} within the {HDL} only. This correlation is interpreted as due to feedback from the newly-formed stars and a change in its slope between the three main star-forming regions is construed as another evolutionary effect. We conclude that triggering has affected the star-formation process in the W3 {GMC} primarily by creating additional dense structures that can collapse into stars. Any traces of changes in {CFE} due to additional turbulence have since been overruled by the feedback effects of the star-forming process itself.},

	abstract = {In this work we have carried out an in-depth analysis of the young stellar content in the W3 {GMC}. The {YSO} population was identified and classified in the {IRAC}/{MIPS} color-magnitude space according to the `Class' scheme and compared to other classifications based on intrinsic properties. Class 0/I and {II} candidates were also compared to low/intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars selected through their colors and magnitudes in 2MASS. We find that a reliable color/magnitude selection of low-mass {PMS} stars in the infrared requires prior knowledge of the protostar population, while intermediate mass objects can be more reliably identified. By means of the {MST} algorithm and our {YSO} spatial distribution and age maps we investigated the {YSO} groups and the star formation history in W3. We find signatures of clustered and distributed star formation in both triggered and quiescent environments. The central/western parts of the {GMC} are dominated by large scale turbulence likely powered by isolated bursts of star formation that triggered secondary star formation events. Star formation in the eastern high density layer also shows signs of extended periods of star formation. While our findings support triggering as a key factor for inducing and enhancing some of the major star forming activity in the {HDL} (e.g., W3 Main/W3({OH})), we argue that some degree of quiescent or spontaneous star formation is required to explain the observed {YSO} population. Our results also support previous studies claiming an spontaneous origin for the isolated massive star(s) powering {KR} 140.},
