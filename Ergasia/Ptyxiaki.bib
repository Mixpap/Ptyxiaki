	abstract = {One view of what triggers star formation has been that self-gravitating  clouds are supported against collapse by magnetic fields, with
gravity-driven ambipolar diffusion reducing support in cores and hence triggering star formation. The newer paradigm is that magnetic fields are too weak to play this dominant role, and that damping of turbulence together with external triggers such as supernovae dominates. The crucial issue is the strength of magnetic fields in regions of star formation. Only observations of magnetic field strengths can settle the issue, and Zeeman observations provide the only direct method for measuring magnetic field strengths in molecular clouds. This talk will report the results of a major new study of magnetic field strengths in dark cloud cores. More than 800 hours of observing time with the Arecibo telescope were used to measure the Zeeman effect in the ground-state lines of {OH} toward 31 cores, and 8 detections were achieved. These new results will be discussed together with all previous results in order to estimate the mass to magnetic flux ratio in star formation regions. The result is that the mass to flux ratio is approximately critical in molecular cores, which implies that magnetic fields are sufficiently strong to play a significant role in support of molecular cores and hence in the star formation process. However, the results of these studies are not definitive in proving that ambipolar diffusion triggers star formation. A new observational test will be briefly described - the direct measurement of the differential mass to magnetic flux ratio between cloud envelopes and cores. This measurement eliminates most of the biases generally present, and should provide a direct test for ambipolar diffusion. If such observations show that the mass to magnetic flux ratio increases from the envelope to the core, that would be direct  evidence supporting the model with ambipolar diffusion
triggering star  formation in these cores. The feasibility and time scale of the proposed  new test will be discussed.},
