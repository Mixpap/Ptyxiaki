	abstract = {Star formation lies at the center of a web of processes that drive cosmic evolution: generation of radiant energy, synthesis of elements, formation of planets, and development of life. Decades of observations have yielded a variety of empirical rules about how it operates, but at present we have no comprehensive, quantitative theory. In this review I discuss the current state of the field of star formation, focusing on three central questions: what controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy converts to stars? What determines how those stars are clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population ends up in gravitationally-bound structures? What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment? I use these three question as a lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginning with a review of the observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve each of the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunities for theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them. I conclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in the coming years.},

	abstract = {We present 12CO, 13CO and C18O J=3-2 maps of the W3 {GMC} made at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We combine these observations with Five Colleges Radio Astronomy Observatory {CO} J=1-0 data to produce the first map of molecular-gas temperatures across a {GMC} and the most accurate determination of the mass distribution in W3 yet obtained. We measure excitation temperatures in the part of the cloud dominated by triggered star formation (the High Density Layer, {HDL}) of 15-30 K, while in the rest of the cloud, which is relatively unaffected by triggering (Low Density Layer, {LDL}), the excitation temperature is generally less than 12 K. We identify a temperature gradient in the {HDL} which we associate with an age sequence in the embedded massive star-forming regions. We measure the mass of the cloud to be 4.4+/-0.4 x 10{\textasciicircum}5 solar masses, in agreement with previous estimates. Existing sub-mm continuum data are used to derive the fraction of gas mass in dense clumps as a function of position in the cloud. This fraction, which we interpret as a Clump Formation Efficiency ({CFE}), is significantly enhanced across the {HDL}, probably due to the triggering. Finally, we measure the 3D rms Mach Number as a function of position and find a correlation between the Mach number and the {CFE} within the {HDL} only. This correlation is interpreted as due to feedback from the newly-formed stars and a change in its slope between the three main star-forming regions is construed as another evolutionary effect. We conclude that triggering has affected the star-formation process in the W3 {GMC} primarily by creating additional dense structures that can collapse into stars. Any traces of changes in {CFE} due to additional turbulence have since been overruled by the feedback effects of the star-forming process itself.},

	abstract = {In this work we have carried out an in-depth analysis of the young stellar content in the W3 {GMC}. The {YSO} population was identified and classified in the {IRAC}/{MIPS} color-magnitude space according to the `Class' scheme and compared to other classifications based on intrinsic properties. Class 0/I and {II} candidates were also compared to low/intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars selected through their colors and magnitudes in 2MASS. We find that a reliable color/magnitude selection of low-mass {PMS} stars in the infrared requires prior knowledge of the protostar population, while intermediate mass objects can be more reliably identified. By means of the {MST} algorithm and our {YSO} spatial distribution and age maps we investigated the {YSO} groups and the star formation history in W3. We find signatures of clustered and distributed star formation in both triggered and quiescent environments. The central/western parts of the {GMC} are dominated by large scale turbulence likely powered by isolated bursts of star formation that triggered secondary star formation events. Star formation in the eastern high density layer also shows signs of extended periods of star formation. While our findings support triggering as a key factor for inducing and enhancing some of the major star forming activity in the {HDL} (e.g., W3 Main/W3({OH})), we argue that some degree of quiescent or spontaneous star formation is required to explain the observed {YSO} population. Our results also support previous studies claiming an spontaneous origin for the isolated massive star(s) powering {KR} 140.},

Combining Spitzer/{IRAC} data with Chandra/Advanced {CCD} Imaging Spectrometer observations, we find 289 cluster members. An additional 340 sources with an infrared excess, but without X-ray counterpart, are classified as cluster member candidates. Both surveys are complete down to stellar masses of about 1 M ?. We present pre-main-sequence isochrones computed for the first time in the Spitzer/{IRAC} colors. The age of the cluster, determined via the location of the Class {III} sources in the [3.6]-[4.5]/[3.6] color-magnitude diagram, is in the range of 3-5?Myr. As theoretically expected, we do not find any systematic variation in the spatial distribution of disks within 0.6 pc of either O-type star in the association. However, the disk fraction in {IC} 1795 does depend on the stellar mass: sources with masses {\textgreater}2 M ? have a disk fraction of {\textasciitilde}20\%, while lower mass objects (2-0.8 M ?) have a disk fraction of {\textasciitilde}50\%. This implies that disks around massive stars have a shorter dissipation timescale.},

	abstract = {Consideration is given to the turbulence properties of molecular clouds and their implications for star formation. Data for 54 molecular clouds and condensations is presented which reveals cloud velocity dispersion and region size to follow a power-law relation, similar to the
Kolmogoroff law for subsonic turbulence. Examination of the dynamics of the molecular clouds for which mass determinations are available reveals essentially all of them to be gravitationally bound, and to
approximately satisfy the virial theorem. The observation of moderate scatter in the dispersion-size relation is noted to imply that most regions have not collapsed much since formation, suggesting that processes of turbulent hydrodynamics have played an important role in producing the observed substructures. A lower limit to the size of subcondensations at which their internal motions are no longer
supersonic is shown to predict a minimum protostellar mass on the order of a few tenths of a solar mass, while massive protostellar clumps are found to develop complex internal structures, probably leading to the formation of prestellar condensation nuclei. The observed turbulence of molecular clouds is noted to imply lifetimes of less than 10 million years.},

	abstract = {We use 2MASS and {MSX} infrared observations, along with new molecular line ({CO}) observations, to examine the distribution of young stellar objects ({YSOs}) in the molecular cloud surrounding the halo {HII} region {KR} 140 in order to determine if the ongoing star-formation activity in this region is dominated by sequential star formation within the photodissociation region ({PDR}) surrounding the {HII} region. We find that {KR} 140 has an extensive population of {YSOs} that have spontaneously formed due to processes not related to the expansion of the {HII} region. Much of the {YSO} population in the molecular cloud is concentrated along a dense filamentary molecular structure, traced by C18O, that has not been erased by the formation of the exciting O star. Some of the previously observed submillimetre clumps surrounding the {HII} region are shown to be sites of recent intermediate and low-mass star formation while other massive starless clumps clearly associated with the {PDR} may be the next sites of sequential star formation.},

	abstract = {The W3 {GMC} is a prime target for the study of the early stages of high-mass star formation. We have used Herschel data from the {HOBYS} key program to produce and analyze column density and temperature maps. Two preliminary catalogs were produced by extracting sources from the column density map and from Herschel maps convolved to 500 μm resolution. Herschel reveals that among the compact sources ({FWHM} {\textless} 0.45 pc), W3 East, W3 West, and W3 ({OH}) are the most massive and luminous and have the highest column density. Considering the unique properties of W3 East and W3 West, the only clumps with ongoing high-mass star formation, we suggest a convergent constructive feedback scenario to account for the formation of a cluster with decreasing age and increasing system/source mass toward the innermost regions. This process, which relies on feedback by high-mass stars to ensure the availability of material during cluster formation, could also lead to the creation of an environment suitable for the formation of Trapezium-like systems. In common with other scenarios proposed in other {HOBYS} studies, our results indicate that an active/dynamic process aiding in the accumulation, compression, and confinement of material is a critical feature of the high-mass star/cluster formation, distinguishing it from classical low-mass star formation. The environmental conditions and availability of triggers determine the form in which this process occurs, implying that high-mass star/cluster formation could arise from a range of scenarios: from large-scale convergence of turbulent flows to convergent constructive feedback or mergers of filaments.},

	abstract = {The well-known shell supernova remnant ({SNR}) {HB}3 is part of a 
feature-rich star-forming region together with the nebulae W3, W4, and
W5. We study the {HI} structure around this {SNR} using five {RATAN}-600 drift
curves obtained at a wavelength of 21 cm with an angular resolution of
2‧ in one coordinate over the radial-velocity range -183 to +60 km
s-1 in a wider region of the sky and with a higher sensitivity than in
previous works by other authors. The spatial-kinematic distribution of
{HI} features around the {SNR} clearly shows two concentric expanding shells
of gas that surround the {SNR} and coincide with it in all three
coordinates (α, δ, and V). The outer shell has a radius of
133 pc, a thickness of 24 pc, and an expansion velocity of 48 km s-1.
The mass of the gas in it is ≈2.3 × 105 M ⊙. For the inner
shell, these parameters are 78 pc, 36 pc, 24 km s- 1, and 0.9 ×
105 M ⊙, respectively. The inner shell is immediately adjacent to
the {SNR}. Assuming that the outer shell was produced by the stellar wind
and the inner shell arose from the shock wave of the {SNR} proper, we
estimated the age of the outer shell, ≈1.7 × 106 yr, and the
mechanical luminosity of the stellar wind, 1.5 × 1038 erg s-1. The
inner shell has an age of ≈106 yr and corresponds to a total
supernova explosion energy of ≈1052 erg.},
