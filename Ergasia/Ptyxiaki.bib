	abstract = {We summarize the first results from the Gould Belt Survey, obtained 
toward the Aquila rift and Polaris Flare regions during the science
demonstration phase of Herschel. Our 70-500 μm images taken in
parallel mode with the {SPIRE} and {PACS} cameras reveal a wealth of
filamentary structure, as well as numerous dense cores embedded in the
filaments. Between {\textasciitilde}350 and 500 prestellar cores and {\textasciitilde}45-60 Class 0
protostars can be identified in the Aquila field, while {\textasciitilde}300 unbound
starless cores and no protostars are observed in the Polaris field. The
prestellar core mass function ({CMF}) derived for the Aquila region bears
a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function ({IMF}), already
confirming the close connection between the {CMF} and the {IMF} with much
better statistics than earlier studies. Comparing and contrasting our
Herschel results in Aquila and Polaris, we propose an
observationally-driven scenario for core formation according to which
complex networks of long, thin filaments form first within molecular
clouds, and then the densest filaments fragment into a number of
prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

Herschel is an {ESA} space observatory with science instruments provided
by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important
participation from {NASA}.Appendix A and Figures 3, 4 are only available
